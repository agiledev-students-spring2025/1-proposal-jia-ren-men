# Project Proposal

## Project Title

Traveler's Memory

## What and Why

An app that allows users to create a virtual trail of memories, tying moments and experiences to specific routes they have traveled. Users can associate photos, videos, or notes with particular segments of a path—whether it’s a hiking trail, a road trip route, or a daily commute. The app is aimed for users to relice those unforgettable momments in their journeys and share to others.

## For whom?

People who loves traveling, hiking, or cherishing everyday moments and wants to preserve their experiences with specific routes for personal reflection or sharing with others

## How?

The user can create a route by recording their location or drawing a path on a map. Users can add multimedia content such as photos, videos, and written notes at key points, and the app allow users to search and browse previously saved trails, either their own or shared by other people from the community.

## Scope

The app may require integration with GPS systems and mapping tools, potentially leveraging Google Maps or Apple Map for route tracking and display. Developers will need to focus on functionalities for saving, managing, and sharing multimedia memory trails, ensuring an intuitive and engaging user experience
